# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Risk Reward by Ruruvision

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A windowed simulation game that uses user input to calculate estimated profits in two different business venture types. The business ventures simulated will be: eventspace/party and retail/restaurant.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will run on the pygame module in python. The game will feature buttons the user can click on to move through the game, as well as rectangular text boxes to input data relevant to the business venture a use wants to simulate. There will be a random module used to create a dial that oscilates left and right. The user will be prompted to stop the dial on a click to generate a random multiplyer factor in the number of customer sales expected to reach to parody the outcome of a business suddenly blowing up in a densley populated area. After the dial is chosen there will be a final screen with the results of said business presented to the user in a table. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will not be plaiing to combine this project with another course's final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will not be planning to work with someone else at this time.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project would include a game with a title screen, buttons, theme music and atleast one business venture simulation working.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish a functioning windowed game using py game that has the option for fullscreen and regular modes, a decorated title screen and theme music that will be mixed and mastered by me on serato pro.There will be the option for a business venture's profits to be simulated and calculated as well as a randomness factor that the user will input by stopping an oscilating dial.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my project will be a pygame that is  able to estimate potential profit earned from two different types of business ventures, the game will also feature theme music and a mute button.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to dowload the pygame module then focus on creating a window, then Id need to figure out how to imprint images into the window and learn how to change the contents of my game window on the click of a button. I will be reasearching the pygame module on python, I will not be working with a classmate.
