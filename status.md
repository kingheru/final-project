Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Ive created a program that loads a window upon startup. The startup window has a custiom title screen with text that prompts the User to Click to Start, when the window screen is clicked the program transitions to anotherscreen. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to create a loop that asks for user inputs in regards to a business venture and then calculates the profit. I also need to create more background images to represent the different stages of the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered any problems besides staying organized and focused in creating the main game loop versus focusing background images and sounds.
