# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

i WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A BUSINESS RISK / REWARD SIMULATOR GAME WITH A FEATURE THAT curTELY CALCULATES POTENTIAL MONLTHY PROFITS WHILE RANDOMLY GENERATING CONSUMER DEMAND.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

At this time, no

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I wonder if I should run my game as a regular python code using idle and turtle graphic, or use a game engine that was suggested in lecture.
